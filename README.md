# Coin_flipper
Practice code for my first repository on GitHub. Python script.

I got this assignment from an acquaintance and decided to put it up here. Feel free to give feedback!

1. Write a function that randomly flips a coin n number of times.  Call this function "flipper".  The function returns h, the number of times the result was "heads", the front side of the coin.
2. Write a "driver"" function that calls "flipper" 1000000 times, flipping the coin 10 times for each call to flipper.  The driver function should keep track of how many times you get a particular result.
